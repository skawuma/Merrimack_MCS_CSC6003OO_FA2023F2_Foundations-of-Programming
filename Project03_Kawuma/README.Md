# Explanation
## I wanted to incorporated all concepts that have been so far been covered.most importantly if and else statement, while loop aand String Operations.The program therefore flows as follows.

## 1. My Program starts with printing out A menu which includes all the problems 

## 2. The user is then prompted to enter an option which coreesponds to the problem number

## 3. After the selecting an option, the function that corresponds to that particular problem is called. After perfoming the operation, the user is asked again to select an option from the main menu.

## 4.Finally when done with all the operations, the user is asked whether to continue or Exit. Using option 8,the User can exit the program.
