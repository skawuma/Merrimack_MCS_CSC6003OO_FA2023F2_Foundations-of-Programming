# Explanation for Best algorithm selection rationale
## Merge sort is a popular sorting algorithm that uses the divide and conquers approach to sort an array (or linked list) of integers (or characters or strings). Here are some rason to use  the merge sort algorithm:
## 1.Merge sort is one of the fastest sorting algorithms that works in O(nlogn) time complexity.
## 2.It is also the best algorithm for sorting linked lists in O(nlogn) time.
## 3.It is an excellent algorithm for learning recursion and problem-solving using the divide and conquer approach. We can use similar ideas to solve several coding questions.
## 4. Merge sort is one of the best algorithms to learn analysis of recursion.
